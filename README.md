A snake game built with Ruby using Gosu. 

Before execution, please make sure you install Gosu: gem install gosu. 

To execute the file, download the file and execute it with the ruby command.  Example: Ruby Snake.rb

Try to eat the "apples", each one will give you a segment and make your snake longer.  try to avoid colliding with the side of the window and your own snake. 

Good Luck!
